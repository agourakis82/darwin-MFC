    therapeuticIndication: "Trizivir is indicated for the treatment of human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) infection in adults. This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar dosages. It is recommended that treatment is started with abacavir, lamivudine,and zidovudine separately for the first six to eight weeks. The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues. The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. In patients with high viral load (&gt;100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration. Overall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that obtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis). Before initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin. Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir (see 'management after an interruption of Trizivir therapy'). Abacavir should not be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele, unless no other therapeutic option is available in these patients, based on the treatment history and resistance testing.",

    therapeuticIndication: "Rheumatoid arthritis \t\t\tLibmyris in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \t\t\t- the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate has been inadequate. \t\t\t- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis \t\t\tPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \t\t\tLibmyris in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARD. Libmyris can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. Enthesitis-related arthritis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy. Axial spondyloarthritis \t\t\tAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Psoriatic arthritis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease and to improve physical function. Psoriasis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. Paediatric plaque psoriasis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe HS (acne inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Crohn’s disease \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Paediatric Crohn's disease \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies. Ulcerative colitis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Paediatric ulcerative colitis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Uveitis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. Paediatric uveitis \t\t\tLibmyris is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. &nbsp;",

In addition, Incresync can be used to replace separate tablets of alogliptin and pioglitazone in those adult patients aged 18 years and older with type-2 diabetes mellitus already being treated with this combination. After initiation of therapy with Incresync, patients should be reviewed after three to six months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response, Incresync should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged pioglitazone therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of Incresync is maintained (see section 4.4).",

Kaposi’s sarcoma is a cancer that causes abnormal tissue to grow under the skin, on moist body surfaces or on internal organs. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal contains the active substance doxorubicin and is a ‘hybrid medicine’. This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ containing the same active substance called Adriamycin. However, in Zolsketil pegylated liposomal the active substance is enclosed in tiny fatty spheres called liposomes, whereas this is not the case for Adriamycin.",

Patients who have a low or very low risk of recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment; the treatment of adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with recurrent and / or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery.  In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of Glivec is based on overall haematological and cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS / MPD, on haematological response rates in HES / CEL and on objective response rates in adult patients with unresectable and / or metastatic GIST and DFSP and on recurrence-free survival in adjuvant GIST. The experience with Glivec in patients with MDS / MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited (see section 5.1). Except in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, there are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases.",

In these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by X-ray, has been demonstrated. Adult Crohn's disease Remicade is indicated for:  treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and / or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies; treatment of fistulising, active Crohn's disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including antibiotics, drainage and immunosuppressive therapy).  Paediatric Crohn's disease Remicade is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn's disease, in children and adolescents aged six to 17 years, who have not responded to conventional therapy including a corticosteroid, an immunomodulator and primary nutrition therapy; or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies. Remicade has been studied only in combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Ulcerative colitis Remicade is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Paediatric ulcerative colitis Remicade is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis, in paediatric patients aged six to 17 years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-MP or AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

Psoriatic arthritis Remicade is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. Remicade should be administered:  in combination with methotrexate; or alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is contraindicated.  Remicade has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease.

Aptivus should only be used as part of an active combination antiretroviral regimen in patients with no other therapeutic options. This indication is based on the results of two phase-III studies, performed in highly pretreated adult patients (median number of 12 prior antiretroviral agents) with virus resistant to protease inhibitors and of one phase-II study investigating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Aptivus in mostly treatment-experienced adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years. In deciding to initiate treatment with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of Aptivus. Initiation of treatment should take into account the combinations of mutations which may negatively impact the virological response to Aptivus, co-administered with low-dose ritonavir.",
