# Darwin-MFC User Research Protocol
## Phase 0: Understanding Global Health Practitioner Needs

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Questions

1. **What clinical knowledge gaps exist** for primary care practitioners in LMICs?
2. **How reliable is internet connectivity** in target contexts?
3. **Is anonymous/pseudonymous participation** essential for engagement?
4. **What learning modalities** are preferred (peer mentorship vs. formal training)?
5. **What devices and connectivity** do practitioners typically have?

### Secondary Questions

- Which medical specialties have the greatest unmet need for decision support?
- What existing tools are practitioners currently using?
- What barriers prevent adoption of digital health tools?
- What community features would drive engagement?

**Duration:** 3-4 weeks active collection

**Languages:** All 9 Darwin-MFC supported locales

### 2. Remote Interviews (Qualitative)

**Platform:** WhatsApp voice/video (most accessible in LMICs)

**Sample Size:** 15-20 interviews

**Selection:** Purposive sampling from survey respondents

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes per interview

**Recording:** Audio only with consent; transcription via Whisper

### 3. Partner Network Consultation

**Organizations to Contact:**
- WONCA (World Organization of Family Doctors) regional chapters
- SBMFC (Brazilian Society of Family Medicine)
- MSF (Doctors Without Borders) digital health team
- WHO AFRO/SEARO digital health initiatives
- Partners in Health
- Praekelt Foundation

## Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent

- Clear explanation of purpose
- Voluntary participation
- Right to withdraw at any time
- No compensation (to avoid coercion)
- Data handling explanation

### Data Protection

- No personally identifiable information (PII) collected
- Survey responses anonymized at collection
- Interview transcripts de-identified
- Data stored securely (encrypted)
- GDPR-compliant practices globally

### Cultural Sensitivity

- Survey translated by native speakers
- Interview questions culturally adapted
- Respect for local norms around hierarchy
- Awareness of gender dynamics in some contexts
